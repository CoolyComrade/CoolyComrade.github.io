        <h3>A Challenge in Dynamics, Controls, and Programming</h3>
        <p>This project was performed on a CRS robot arm, a DSP, and Code Composer Studio. Simulations were performed using Mathematica, Matlab, and Simulink. 
            Becoming acquainted with the physical parameters of the arm was necessary to perform proper calculations pertaining to the 
            dynamics of the robot and for controller design. The below diagram from the CRS manual was used to do this.
        </p>

        <p>To begin the project, the robot needed to be calibrated. Because the robot was a double linkage, there were three main positions in which the robot needed 
            to be placed in order to correctly map the movements of the robot to a cartesian basis. By calibrating in these positions, zero degrees and ninety degrees
            in each motor was established. Doing this allowed me to map the angular positions of each motor to the location of the end-effector, thus performing the
            project by D-H convention.

        <p>Above, the three positions are shown: Upright, angled at ninety degrees, and outward. Additionally, the base of this arm swiveled, so a marker was placed
            to indicate an arbitrary zero position.

        <p>From there, I was able to implement a PID controller for the robot's motion. In this figure, the motion is simply rotating about the base joint.
            Because of the PID controller, I was able to control damping and minimize overshooting during the motion from position to position. As is shown
            in the plot, the motion of the robot (yellow) follows the simulated motion (purple) very closely.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to this, friction compensation was added to the controller such that all motions were unaffected by frictional forces. When no motion
            was planned and the robot was subjected to force from my hand, the robot would move smoothly. This was my first time implementing force control.
        </p>
        <p>One more controller that assisted in my completion of the obstacle course was impedance control. This allowed the end-effector to be guided in
            specific directions while maintaining rigidity in all other directions. In the case of this project, the impedance controller allowed me to move
            the robot in the path of the obstacle course while remaining undisturbed by the walls and contacts around it.
