        <h3>Getting Involved with Electronics and Hardware</h3>
        <p>I joined the Special Projects team of iRobotics in hopes of kickstarting my knowledge in robotics and getting a headstart in my secondary field.
            Being closely involved in this group allowed me to practice circuitry, dynamics, and controls. I like to believe that my involvement in this groups is
            what got me into my research group, Dynamic Robotics Laboratory under Professor Hae-Won Park.
        </p>
        <p>Special Projects is focused on building an exhibit for Engineering Open House (EOH) at U of I. For the past couple years, the group has been building a
            robotic arm for playing with the children who attend the event. In the year that I was with the team, the project was only beginning. I was involved
            in much of the initial planning and foundation of the project that is still being worked on to this day.
        </p>

        <p>The original objective of the robot was to be able to play <em>Rock, Paper, Scissors</em> with exhibitionists. In the above sketch, a hand was included with
            the arm and would be dextrous enough to position itself as needed to play the game. However, by the time EOH came around, the hand was unfinished and could
            not be incorporated into the robot. This being the case, only a two-jointed arm was showcased to spectators in 2017.
        </p>

        </div>        
        <p>Although I was determined to dive into hardware during this project, I was the only one on the team who had a background in mechanics and mechanical
            engineering. Therefore, I was pigeonholed as "the machinist". Unfortunately, I had no certifications to use any of the larger tools like the buzz
            saw (So much for that nickname). So all sawing happened using a hack saw. And yes, the sound was horrific since the arm was made of aluminum. In situations 
            where I needed to have more specialized equipment, such as waterjetting or welding, I just consulted the machine shop at the Mechanical Engineering
            Laboratory or I consulted a friend who was certified through the Engineering Student Projects Laboratory.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>Regardless, I made quick work of those tasks and was able to get started on learning how to assemble circuits and operate motors using an Arduino.
            Here, I experimented with stepper motors and a remote controller to see if I would be able to involve these in the project without the team having 
            to buy servos. Although I was able to get well-acquainted with programming in C and get the motors operating, they were not nearly strong enough to
            hold up the aluminum links.
        </p>
        <img id="fig6" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5tRhnjCJr-jfmxBiW0bjJ2nFRbvE2CVnRXv9yzRk0VqJnhr4CbE0paEmIDn_vCpykkgph6dPLFQgO4VVRUcqFytDfEfXWXbWlZCy7BRi5jk6UhLyEEJtjq6NQNdFP8h2u4PaKQiDrw=w2400">
        <p>And so once we acquired servos, we were able to begin assembling the arm. Independently, the joints moved without a problem. But once the joints were
            joined to make an arm, the servo at the shoulder began to struggle since they were carrying call the weight of the rest of the limb. To remedy this
            issue, we had to find a way to allow more power and less load on the servos.
        </p>

        <p>With the new voltage source, I was able to build a schematic to distribute the power properly. All other circuitry remained the same with the arduino controlling
            the operation. The servo at the elbow was struggling with the load placed on it. An easy fix that I incorporated was using a rubber 
            band to reduce the torque necessary to lift the arm against gravity. Although this was a temporary solution for the elbow, the shoulder still needed much
            more support. And so I did a little bit of research into actuators.
        </p>

        <p>The above actuator was capable of exerting 25lbs of thrust and had a 6" stroke which was all that was needed to move the shoulder.</p>

        <p>Here is what was presented at EOH 2017. Although the project was incomplete without a hand, the families that stopped by were fascinated by the operation of the
            arm. It was controlled through the Arduino interface.
