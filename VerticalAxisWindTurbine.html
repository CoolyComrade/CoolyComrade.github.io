        <h3>First Joining Wide Impact Developmental Engineering (WIDE)</h3>
        <p>WIDE was one of the first groups I joined when I started attending U of I as a freshman.
            At the time, the group had already built a vertical axis wind turbine. The device had three blades and generated enough power to light a
            small rural household. However, the device was heavy and could not be easily transported to locations in rural America. Additionally,
            the gearbox was unprotected, resulting in material corrosion.</p>

        <p>This version of the turbine had been disassembled for parts to build the newer turbine which I worked on. Starting out the project,
            I performed calculations for power to find proper dimensions to begin CAD modeling. All CAD was performed in Solidworks.

        <p>Here is the rendering of the CAD for the four-bladed propeller of the turbine. It was decided that the blades would be made of aluminum
            because it is strong for its weight and relatively inexpensive in comparison to other metals. 
            The crosses on the top and at the hub were made of stainless steel which is nearly resistant to rusting.
        </p>        
        <p>The base of the hub was made of injection molded polyethylene. During the prototyping phase, this was made of PLA and was additively manufactured.
            Because of the complex geometry of this object, it was a great candidate for AM. But ultimately, injection molding provided the
            benefit of being isotropic, which is something that is left to be desired in fused deposition modeling and several other AM methods.
        </p>

        <p>The progress made on the propeller was the bulk of my involvement in the project. I was responsible for much of the CAD modelling
            (smaller components were sourced from McMaster Carr) and the prototyping. Most of the prototyping performed was done through FDM.
            The final product was made from aluminum 6061-T6 and 304 stainless steel.
