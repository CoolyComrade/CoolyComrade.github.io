    <h2>My Name is Harold Solomon</h2>
    <p>I have been involved in engineering since high school, having won second place in state at the Illinois Drafting
        Educators Association Competition and being a coach for my high school's Engineering Drafters club. I have been CAD modeling ever since and 
        it is still something I enjoy doing when I begin new projects. With my hometown in the Chicago suburb of South Elgin, I have lived my entire 
        life in Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mechanics and a secondary
        field in Autonomous Controls and Robotics. During my time at Illinois, I was able to grow into the free-thinker that I am today. I am very
        enthusiastic about mechanical engineering and technology as well as topics in the LGBT+ community, which I have come to love for the people I 
        met within and for the pride I find in this identity.
    </p>
    <h3>An Innovator in Engineering and Technology</h3>
    <p>When I first started attending U of I as a student in Mechanical Science and Engineering (MechSE for short), I knew that I wanted to use the
        knowledge that I gained to expand the reach of engineering and tech. With my background in mechanics, I received a thorough understanding of
        the physical world. But to promote my endeavors even further, I decided to choose a focus for my major which was relevant to machine learning,
        which has experienced an upsurgence in popularity in many industries in recent years. From these aspects of my education, in addition to my
        own efforts through projects, I have incorporated the two fields into my skill set.
    </p>
    <p>During my undergrad, I worked on seven different robots ranging from walkers to collaborators to drones; I worked in a robotics laboratory,
        researching the dynamics and control of search and rescue robots by performing tests and simulations; I delved into artificial intelligence
        to increase my knowledge and experience with reinforcement learning and neural networks. I have been involved with trailblazers and pioneers
        and I wish to extend what I have learned to those around me.
    </p>
    <h3>An Effective Leader and an Advocate for Diversity</h3>
    <p>I have had the honor of participating on executive boards for organizations on campus. As the President of Out in STEM (oSTEM), I was able to
        promote LGBT+ identites in STEM fields. While overseeing the organization, I have seen the community come to be embraced at U of I and I
        watched members attend career fairs and get jobs and internships without having to feel insecure about their identities. I am happy knowing
        that I was able to contribute to the acceptance of sexual and gender diversity on campus and to all the companies and universities where our
        members ended up.
    </p>
    <p>I was also the Vice President of Membership of Pi Tau Sigma Mechanical Engineering Honor Society where I ensured that the organization retained
        a high volume of members. When first beginning my role, I found a way to perform my duties in a way that would draw in members while remaining
        significantly below the budget for the semester. I was able to bring in workshops for members to gain useful knowledge and skills so that
        they could leave meetings with a better grasp on how to navigate their careers. This role was exciting for me because it gave me the
        opportunity to reach out around campus to bring in guests for our society.
